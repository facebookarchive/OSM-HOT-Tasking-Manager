# Shell migration script

These migration scripts allow to restore deleted projects using postgres commands. For now, there are two scripts:
1. dbtocsv.sh: By setting the required variables, this script reads the defined project ids within the PROJECT_IDS variable and starts saving the required information for each table in a csv file.
2. restart_table.sh: which destroys and then creates with postgis extension the desired database. However, migration tables are not executed within this script. You need to run `python manage.py db upgrade` yourself everytime the database is restarted.

Tables to migrate and verify if they are necessary to:
[x] projects 
[] messages
[x] project_allowed_users
[x] project_chat
[x] project_info
[x] project_priority_areas
[x] task_history
[x] task_invalidation_history
[x] tasks

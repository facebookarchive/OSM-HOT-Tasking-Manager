## Information

The [MapWithAI](https://mapwith.ai) Tasking Manager is an extension of the [HOT Tasking Manager](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager). This repository aims to further integrate MapWithAI's data sets into the TM to improve project planning and task distribution. We will also be deploying new features to help improve other aspects of the Tasking Manager.

The most popular tool for teams to coordinate mapping on OpenStreetMap. With this web application an area of interest can be defined and divided up into smaller tasks that can be completed rapidly. It shows which areas need to be mapped and which areas need a review for quality assurance. You can see the tool in action: log into the widely used [HOT Tasking Manager](https://tasks.hotosm.org/) and start mapping.

This is Free and Open Source Software. You are welcome to use the code and set up your own instance. The Tasking Manager has been initially designed and built by and for the [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/), and is nowadays used by many communities and organizations.
